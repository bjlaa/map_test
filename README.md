# map_test

### Getting started:
To run the development server you'll need to install browser-sync on your computer. To do so, in the console type in:

```
npm install -g browser-sync
```

Once this is done, change directory to the folder map_test and type in:
```
./startDevServer.sh
```

A tab should automatically open in your browser. Auto-refresh in enabled, yeay!
